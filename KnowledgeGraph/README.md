KnowledgeGraph
This directory is dedicated to the Knowledge Graph component of the Movie Recommendation System. Its primary role is to construct, populate, and manage a rich, interconnected graph database of movie-related entities and their relationships. This structured data is crucial for enabling semantic search, contextual recommendations, and providing explainability for the recommendations generated by the overall system.

Introduction
In modern recommendation systems, moving beyond simple collaborative filtering can significantly enhance the quality and relevance of suggestions. This Knowledge Graph component aims to achieve this by:

Modeling movies, actors, directors, genres, users, and their interactions as nodes and relationships in a graph.

Enabling more complex queries for recommendation logic (e.g., "movies watched by actors who also worked with a specific director and are of a certain genre").

Providing a foundation for explainable AI in recommendations by tracing why a movie was recommended.

Purpose and Role
The KnowledgeGraph module is responsible for:

Data Ingestion and Transformation: Taking raw movie data (e.g., MovieLens datasets, external APIs) and transforming it into a format suitable for graph insertion.

Schema Definition: Defining the nodes (entities) and relationships that form the backbone of our movie knowledge graph.

Graph Population: Inserting the transformed data into a chosen graph database.

Graph Interaction: Providing interfaces or scripts for querying and retrieving information from the knowledge graph, which can then be utilized by other parts of the recommendation system (e.g., the recommendation engine itself).

Key Technologies
The implementation of this knowledge graph component relies on:

Python 3.x: The primary programming language.

[Graph Database Name (e.g., Neo4j)]: The chosen graph database for storing the knowledge graph.

[Graph Driver/Client Library (e.g., py2neo for Neo4j, python-neo4j)]: Python library for programmatic interaction with the graph database.

pandas: For efficient data loading, manipulation, and preprocessing.

[Any other relevant libraries like rdflib, networkx, spacy if used for NLP on movie descriptions, etc.]

Knowledge Graph Schema
The knowledge graph models the following core entities (nodes) and their relationships:

Nodes:

:Movie: Represents a film. Properties might include title, releaseYear, imdbId, tmdbId, plotSummary, averageRating.

:Actor: Represents an actor. Properties might include name, gender, birthYear.

:Director: Represents a director. Properties might include name, gender.

:Genre: Represents a movie genre. Properties include name (e.g., "Action", "Comedy").

:User: Represents a user of the recommendation system. Properties include userId.

Relationships:

(:Movie)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(:Genre): A movie belongs to one or more genres.

(:Movie)-[:DIRECTED_BY]->(:Director): A movie is directed by a director.

(:Actor)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie): An actor performed in a movie.

(:User)-[:RATED {score: <rating_value>}]->(:Movie): A user gave a specific rating to a movie.

(:Movie)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(:Movie): (Optional, if pre-computed similarities are stored) Indicates content-based or collaborative similarities between movies.

(Note: This is a common schema. Please update it to accurately reflect the nodes and relationships you have defined in your graph.)

Setup and Usage
To set up and populate the knowledge graph:

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

Install and run your chosen Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j Community Edition). Make sure it's accessible and running on the configured host/port.

Install the necessary Python dependencies:

Bash

# Navigate to the root of the repository
# cd ../..
pip install -r requirements.txt
# If requirements.txt is not in the root, and specific to this KG folder:
# cd KnowledgeGraph
# pip install pandas <your-graph-client-library>
Configuration:

Review and update config.py with your graph database connection details (e.g., URI, username, password) and any specific file paths for your raw data.

Data Preparation:

Place your raw dataset files (e.g., movies.csv, ratings.csv from MovieLens) into the data/raw/ directory.

Run any data preprocessing scripts if separate:

Bash

python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
(This script might output cleaned files into data/processed/)

Build and Populate the Graph:

Execute the main script to build the schema and populate the database:

Bash

python scripts/build_graph.py
This script will connect to your graph database, define the node labels and relationship types, and then ingest the processed data.

Explore and Test:

Once populated, you can use the graph database's native browser/UI (e.g., Neo4j Browser) to visually inspect your graph.

Refer to notebooks/kg_exploration.ipynb (if available) for interactive examples of querying and analyzing the graph using Python.

Data Sources
The knowledge graph is constructed primarily from the following datasets:

MovieLens Latest Small Dataset:

Source: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/

Files used: movies.csv (for movie metadata and genres) and ratings.csv (for user-movie interactions).

[Any other sources, e.g., TMDB API for additional movie details, IMDb, etc.]: Specify the source and how it's integrated.

Further Exploration
To understand how the knowledge graph integrates with the broader recommendation system, refer to the main project's README.md.

Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for detailed steps and insights into data processing and graph querying.
